        "subtitle": "A heat pumpis a device that is using the energy in the environment, such as air or ground, and transfers it to be used for heating or cooling purposes. Thermal energy naturally flows from places with higher temperature to locations with lower temperatures (e.g., in the winter, heat from inside the building is lost to the outside and in the summer heat from the outside flows into the interior of the building). A heat pump uses additional electrical energy to counter the natural flow of heat, and, in heating mode, pumps the energy available from a colder place to a warmer one. Since a heat pump transfers thermal energy (vs. a gas furnace or an electrical baseboard, which convert other sources of energy to thermal energy), it offers a higher energy efficiency, potentially saving on energy costs and reducing your carbon footprint.",

        "homesContent": "Many homes in moderate climates can rely on air source heat pumps for heating or cooling year-round. More recently, a new generation of air-source heat pump, often called cold-climate heat pump, has been introduced to improve performance of these systems in the colder temperatures of Canadian winters. This improved performance vs. conventional air-source heat pumps reduces the need for auxiliary heating sources. Ground source heat pumps are effective in all climates",
        "mechanicalSystemTitle": "Mechanical system",
        "mechanicalSystemContent": "A mechanical system contractor or energy advisor can help with estimating the economics of purchasing and operating a heat pump in your area and the potential savings you can achieve. Heat pumps can come at a higher purchase cost compared to other heating systems due to the number of components in the system. In some regions and situations, this added cost can be recouped in a relatively short period through energy cost savings. However, in other regions, varying utility rates can extend this period. Speak with your energy advisor to see if a heat pump is right for you."
